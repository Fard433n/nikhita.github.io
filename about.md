<br>


I am Nikhita Raghunath, an undergraduate from VJTI, Mumbai. I was a Google Summer of Code (2017) student for the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) working on Kubernetes. You can know more about my GSoC work [here](https://github.com/nikhita/gsoc-meta-k8s).

I am interested in backend applications, distributed systems and Linux. I like programming in Go, C++, C and Python. I also like to give talks at conferences and speak about my work.

This blog is used not only to catalogue projects that I embark on but also to serve as an outlet for my more long-form thoughts on software engineering as both a discipline and an industry.

Feel free to reach out to me at these places.
